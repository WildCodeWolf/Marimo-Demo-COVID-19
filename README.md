# `marimo` Demo:  COVID-19

This repo contains a simple interactive website built from a [`marimo`](https://marimo.io) notebook.
It showcases `marimo`'s interactive capabilities by letting the viewer select aspects of the data
inspected and applies them to the plotted data.  Even more interactivity is added by allowing the
selection of a country by clicking on the map, and having the second graphic display COVID-19 cases
for that country.

The dataset itself is publicly available on https://www.openml.org/d/43412 and gets loaded dynamically
at runtime.  The app itself contains and explains more information.  Feel free to check it out.
